Open the main and set a password that you desire in the passWord variable. The default password is "password".
There is a sample text file included in the folder labled "textFile" named "cpt.txt". 
You could use another file if you desire, just make sure to change the variable, "fileName" to the name of your file
and make sure that your file is added to the "textFile" folder.

Next, just run the program and the program will create two new files for you, 1st the encrypted version and 2nd the decrypted version
of your file. It will be located in the "textFile" folder, so make sure to refresh in order to see it.

Enjoy.
